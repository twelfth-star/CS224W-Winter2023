The graph class `nx.Graph` provides rich analysis and manipulation functionalities, such as the clustering coefficient and PageRank. To feed the graph into the model, we need to transform the graph into tensor representations including edge tensor `edge_index` and node attributes tensors `x` and `y`. But only using tensors (as the graphs formatted in PyG `datasets` and `data`) will make many graph manipulations and analysis less efficient and harder. So, in this Colab we will use DeepSNAP which combines both representations and offers a full pipeline for GNN training / validation / testing.\n"

We will draw upon our understanding of heterogeneous graphs from lecture and previous work in implementing GNN layers using PyG (introduced in Colab 3).\n",

Note: during message passing we view each message as (src, relation, dst), where messages \"flow\" from src to dst node types. For example, during message passing, updating node type $b$ relies on two different message types $m_2$ and $m_3$.\n",
        "\n",
        "When applying message passing in heterogenous graphs, we seperately apply message passing over each message type. Therefore, for the graph $G$, a heterogeneous GNN layer contains three seperate Heterogeneous Message Passing layers (`HeteroGNNConv` in this Colab), where each `HeteroGNNConv` layer performs message passing and aggregation with respect to *only one message type*. Since a message type is viewed as (src, relation, dst) and messages \"flow\" from src to dst, each `HeteroGNNConv` layer only computes embeddings for the *dst* nodes of a given message type. For example, the `HeteroGNNConv` layer for message type $m_2$ outputs updated embedding representations *only* for node's with type b. \n",

Note that these embeddings can rely on one or more intermediate `HeteroGNNConv` layer embeddings(i.e. $H_b^{(l)}$ combines $H_b^{(l)[m_2]}$ and $H_b^{(l)[m_3]}$).\n",
        "\n",

This wrapper manages and combines the output of each `HeteroGNNConv` layer in order to generate the complete updated node embeddings for each node type in layer $l$ of our model. More specifically, the $l^{th}$ `HeteroGNNWrapperConv` layer takes as input the node embeddings computed for each message type and node type (e.g. $H_b^{(l)[m_2]}$ and $H_b^{(l)[m_3]}$) and aggregates across message types with the same $dst$ node type. The resulting output of the $l^{th}$ `HeteroGNNWrapperConv` layer is the updated embedding matrix $H_i^{(l)}$ for each node type i. \n",
